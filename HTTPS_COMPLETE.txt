  ✓ ME_CAM.com domain configured (works on any network)
  ✓ Multi-device support ready (each customer gets their own Pi)
  ✓ Camera streaming fixed (domain-aware)
  ✓ Dashboard updated (works with domain or IP)
  ✓ Production-ready for customer shipment

================================================================================
YOUR PI IS READY
================================================================================

Current Setup:
  ✓ Service: Running with HTTPS
  ✓ Certificates: Generated (valid 365 days)
  ✓ Domain: ME_CAM.com (added to Pi /etc/hosts)
  ✓ Dashboard: https://ME_CAM.com:8080
  ✓ Camera: Streaming (domain-aware)
  ✓ Motion: Detecting (logging events)
  ✓ API: All 15+ endpoints working

================================================================================
IMMEDIATE TEST: ACCESS YOUR PI
================================================================================

Step 1: Add ME_CAM.com to Your Windows Hosts File
  
  Option A (Easy - Automatic):
    Run: setup-domain-windows.bat (as Administrator)
    It will ask for your Pi IP and add it automatically
  
  Option B (Manual):
    1. Open Notepad as Administrator
    2. Open: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
    3. Add this line at bottom:
       10.2.1.47   ME_CAM.com
    4. Save

Step 2: Open Browser
  
  Go to: https://ME_CAM.com:8080
  
  First time warning:
    "Your connection is not secure" or "NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID"
    This is NORMAL! Click:
    - Chrome: Advanced → Proceed to ME_CAM.com (unsafe)
    - Firefox: Advanced... → Accept the Risk and Continue
    - Safari: Show Details → Visit this website
  
Step 3: Login
  
  Username: admin
  Password: admin
  
  ⚠️  IMPORTANT: Change this password immediately!
      Go to Settings → Change Password

Step 4: Test Everything
  
  ✓ Camera stream visible (live video)
  ✓ Motion Events modal (click button, see 24h motion)
  ✓ Storage Details modal (see disk usage)
  ✓ Recordings modal (see video files)
  ✓ Quality selector (change resolution)
  ✓ Wave your hand → Check motion event appears

Expected Results:
  - Stream resolution shows: 640x480 (or selected quality)
  - FPS shows: 10-30 depending on quality
  - Motion confidence: 0.85-0.95 when moving
  - No errors in browser console (F12)

MULTI-DEVICE SUPPORT (Multiple Pis Per Customer)
================================================================================

Scenario 1: Customer has 2 cameras in different rooms

Option A (RECOMMENDED - Separate Subdomains):
  
  Device 1: https://cam1.ME_CAM.com:8080
  Device 2: https://cam2.ME_CAM.com:8080
  Device 3: https://cam3.ME_CAM.com:8080
  
  Windows hosts file:
    10.2.1.47  cam1.ME_CAM.com
    10.2.1.48  cam2.ME_CAM.com
    10.2.1.49  cam3.ME_CAM.com

Option B (Alternative - Different Ports):
  
  Device 1: https://ME_CAM.com:8080
  Device 2: https://ME_CAM.com:8081
  Device 3: https://ME_CAM.com:8082
  
  Requires: Modify app.py port for each device
  
  On Device 2, edit ~/ME_CAM-DEV/web/app.py:
    Change: app.run(..., port=8081, ...)
    Restart: sudo systemctl restart mecamera

Scenario 2: Multiple customers (your sales)
  
  Customer 1: Pi IP 10.2.1.47 → ME_CAM.com
  Customer 2: Pi IP 10.2.1.48 → ME_CAM.com (their own setup)
  Customer 3: Pi IP 10.2.1.49 → ME_CAM.com (their own setup)
  
  Each customer:
    1. Gets unique Pi with unique IP
    2. Adds their own ME_CAM.com mapping in their hosts file
    3. Only sees their own Pi
    4. No conflicts (each has their own domain mapping)

QUESTIONS?
================================================================================

Common Questions:

Q: Can I change the ME_CAM.com domain to my company name?
A: Yes! Edit your setup script and documentation to use your domain name.
   Example: https://mycompany.com:8080
   Just add your domain to the hosts file instead.

Q: What if customer's IP changes?
A: Setup script handles this. They just need to update their hosts file
   with the new IP. Can create auto-updater script if needed.

Q: Can I sell this commercially?
A: Yes! License is MIT - you can modify and resell. Just keep license
   notice in code. See LICENSE file for details.

Q: How do I update customers' firmware?
A: Use setup.sh script. Push updates via Git, customers run:
   cd ~/ME_CAM-DEV && git pull && sudo systemctl restart mecamera

Q: Can customer use this away from home?
A: Yes, with port forwarding and DDNS, or:
   - Commercial VPN service
   - Tailscale (free, secure mesh network)
   - ZeroTier (free, decentralized VPN)

Q: What about data privacy?
A: All data stays on their Pi. Never leaves the device. No cloud.
   No logs sent anywhere. Fully under their control.

Q: Can I add AI detection?
A: Yes! TensorFlow Lite support built-in. Models loaded from:
   src/detection/ai_person_detector.py
   Add your own models there.

Q: White-label options?
A: Yes! Replace:
   - "ME Camera" branding → Your company name
   - Dashboard colors → Your brand colors
   - Logo → Your logo
   - Domain → Your domain name
   Just edit HTML/CSS/config files
