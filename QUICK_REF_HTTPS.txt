TROUBLESHOOTING:

Problem: Dashboard won't load
  - Check hosts file: ME_CAM.com mapped to correct IP
  - Check Pi is on: ping ME_CAM.com
  - Restart service: ssh pi@pi "sudo systemctl restart mecamera"
  - Check logs: ssh pi@pi "sudo journalctl -u mecamera -n 50"

Problem: Camera is black
  - Check camera connected: ssh pi@pi "libcamera-still --list-cameras"
  - Restart service: sudo systemctl restart mecamera
  - Wait 10 seconds, refresh browser

Problem: "Not Secure" warning
  - This is NORMAL with self-signed certs
  - Click "Advanced" → "Proceed"
  - No security issue on local network
  - Use LetsEncrypt cert for production (optional)

Problem: Can't login
  - Default: admin / admin
  - Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
  - Try different browser
  - Check service running: sudo systemctl status mecamera
