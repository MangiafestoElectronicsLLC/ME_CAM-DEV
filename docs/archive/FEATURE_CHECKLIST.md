python3 -c "from thumbnail_gen import extract_thumbnail; print('OK')"

# 4. Restart service:
sudo systemctl restart mecamera.service

# 5. Check logs:
sudo journalctl -u mecamera.service -n 20

# 6. Open browser:
# http://<pi-ip>:8080 → Login (PIN: 1234)
# Check dashboard loads with thumbnails

## 📋 Post-Deployment QA

### Functional Tests
- [ ] Login with PIN → Dashboard loads
- [ ] Dashboard shows real-time battery % or "External Power"
- [ ] Dashboard shows real storage usage (GB + bar)
- [ ] Dashboard shows history count (24h events)
- [ ] Dashboard shows recent recordings with **thumbnail images**
- [ ] Click Settings → Form loads with current values
- [ ] Toggle Email checkbox → SMTP form appears
- [ ] Fill email form → Click Save → Config updated
- [ ] Navigate to /api/stream → MJPEG video stream plays
- [ ] Wave hand in front of camera → New clip appears in grid within 10s
- [ ] Recorded clip is automatically encrypted (check recordings_encrypted/)
- [ ] Logout → Redirects to login page
- [ ] Access dashboard without login → Redirects to login page

### Non-Functional Tests
- [ ] Dashboard renders in <2s
- [ ] No JavaScript console errors (F12)
- [ ] Thumbnails load without 404 errors
- [ ] Stream endpoint doesn't crash on camera disconnect
- [ ] Service restarts cleanly: `sudo systemctl restart mecamera.service`
- [ ] Logs are clean (no ERROR or Exception messages for normal operation)

### Edge Cases
- [ ] No recordings exist → "No recordings yet" message shows
- [ ] Thumbnail generation fails → Filename fallback displays
- [ ] Stream camera not available → Handled gracefully, returns error
- [ ] Invalid SMTP → Email toggle stays disabled, error logged
- [ ] Config reload while recording → Doesn't interrupt clip
