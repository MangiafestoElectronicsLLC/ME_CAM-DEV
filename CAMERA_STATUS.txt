## Your Task: Fix the Camera Hardware

### Option 1: Quick Auto-Fix (Recommended)
SSH into your Pi and run:

```bash
ssh pi@10.2.1.47

# Enable camera in system config
sudo raspi-config nonint do_camera 0

# Reboot
sudo reboot

# Wait 30 seconds, then verify
libcamera-hello --list-cameras
```

### Option 2: Manual Troubleshooting
See: `FIX_CAMERA_IMX7098.md` in your project directory

## Test Dashboard Now

1. **Open**: http://10.2.1.47:8080
2. **You should see**: Test pattern with status info
3. **Try these**:
   - Scroll dashboard - responsive on mobile/tablet
   - Click settings - all tabs work
   - Emergency buttons - should respond
   - Check quick stats - will update with real FPS once camera works

## Once Camera Works

The test pattern will **automatically** disappear and show the real live feed. No code changes needed!
